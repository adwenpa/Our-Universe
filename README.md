# Our-Universe

Why This Project

This project, Our-Universe, is my attempt show some of the many amazing pictures available on the various NASA websites. There is a lot of beauty around us, and also, some dangers. Yes, there are dangerous asteroids and other near earth objects that can possibly end life on earth. Unfortunately, I don't have presentable information on that.

API

You may request an API key for NASA Astronomy Picture of the Day (APOD) at https://api.nasa.gov/ but you may not need it. There is a demo key allows limited access:

Hourly Limit: 30 requests per IP address per hour
Daily Limit: 50 requests per IP address per day

Once you have your API key, you can replace the demo key in the file ./public/js/apod.js.

To run the app on your machine:

1. Clone the project https://github.com/adwenpa/Our-Universe.

2. You will be able to run the app from your computer: ... /Our-Universe/public/index.html.

3. I am using node v20.18.0, express -version 4.16.1

Areas I covered:

Web Development Capstone Features List 1. Choose at least two of the following:

Analyze data that is stored in arrays, objects, sets or maps and display information about it in your app.

Calculate and display data based on an external factor (ex: get the current date, and display how many days remaining until some event)

Choose at least one of the following:

Retrieve data from a third-party API and use it to display something within your app.

OPTIONAL - Can swap with items from section one:

Create a node.js web server using a modern framework such as Express.js or Fastify.Â  Serve at least one route that your app uses (must serve more than just the index.html file).
